# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
 hardhat help
 hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true  hardhat test
 hardhat node
 hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
 yarn add hardhat-gas-reporter
 yarn hardhat overage
```
